# Echoes-of-Existence
“Echoes of Existence” is an interactive generative art project inspired by the poetry collection
Blood Orange by Mx. Yaffa As, a Muslim trans Indigenous Palestinian. The project seeks to
encourage self-expression by using sound, text, and visual art to transform participants' voices
into dynamic, generative artwork. Through this process, it fosters a sense of belonging and
inclusivity, reducing the pressure of vocal expression while celebrating the value of each
individual’s perspective. At its core, the project aims to demonstrate the power of collective
resonance, showing how a single voice can ripple outward and contribute to a larger echo of
strength and solidarity. The use of symbolic colors—purple, representing Palestine’s national
flower, the Gilboa Iris, and orange, representing the Jaffa Orange—reinforces themes of
resilience, strength, and cultural identity, aligning with the book's message of peace and unity.
