# Echoes-of-Existence
The project seeks to encourage self-expression by using sound, text, and visual art to transform participants' voices into dynamic, generative artwork. At its core, it aims to demonstrate the power of collective resonance, showing how a single voice can ripple outward and contribute to a larger echo of strength and solidarity
